When I saw the opportunity to take this class this semester, I signed up as soon as possible. Before my class I didn’t know Python was a coding class.  After reading the syllabus and launching Datacamp I was immediately intimated because this is a new language for me. All I know is I want to be an analyst and I have to practice and put in the effort to get there in order to learn as much as possible about coding. When I was doing my Datacamp exercises, I didn't really comprehend the homework because I would write down the code and then when the exercise came up for the video, I would always get it wrong. When I first heard about the assignment, I was concerned because I knew I wasn't grasping the homework. However, after reviewing the Signature Term Project guidelines, I was able to follow the instructions and insert the needed code. Despite the fact that I did not follow all of the rules, such as naming my data file \"df1,\" I ended up spelling the entire word out \"dataset.\"  Overall, reading the directions and the hints made me feel more at ease while working on the project. If an issue occurred and I didn't understand why, I would YouTube the error in an attempt to remedy my mistakes. But as I came to task four, I felt more at ease since what I was learning was clicking and making sense to me. After completing my project I felt that I learned how to code because I am the type of person who has to read and do the hands on portion to fully grasp what’s being asked. I personally feel if I took this class in the fall and my professor broke down each topic and gave me a homework assignment like this project I would feel more comfortable by the end of the semester. Python is a new language for me and everything seemed so hard at first but after taking this class I feel that I can continue learning this program.  Based on the three-week time frame, I believe that if my professor had not supplied me with the hints that he provided us with in the project instruction, I would not have completed my project on time because Datacamp did not provide as much of a break down.  After taking this class, I'd like to know how I may continue my education in Python since I want to understand everything I can about this program because my objective is to work as an analyst.  Taking this class this semester has helped me grasp business information because the data information provided to us in Excel reveals that removing Null and altering columns on Excel would have took me a lengthier time. Python demonstrates that it is faster and more convenient than scrolling down each row and eliminating Null from each column. This lesson has assisted me in developing a new skill set because I now know how to make my life easier while attempting to update data rather than doing everything in Excel. I had an interview for an analyst position before to attending this class. The interviewer asked me to pivot various departments from the excel document that was provided to me. When I did the test, I felt like it took forever since, even if I filter Pivot, the process of unchecking boxes took a long time. Now that I'm familiar with Python, I'd like to go over that scenario again.  Learning about GitHub is significant because it made it simple to save and share my project. I wish we had spent more time working on more projects so that I could become more comfortable doing the task. Overall, I'd like to take another Pyhton lesson. Even if our school did not offer it, I would desire to further my education through this program.\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;37m                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ^\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;31mSyntaxError\u001b[0m\u001b[1;31m:\u001b[0m invalid character '’' (U+2019)\n"
